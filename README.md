# typing game interface

## Installation

Install SDL2 in your computer. I'm using `#include<SDL2/SDL.h>`, so if you have a linux you're probably ok. If not, let me know so we can configure OS specific import. If you use windows os, I don't care about you.

```bash
    make all
    make run

```

And you should be able to see a little window popping up!
